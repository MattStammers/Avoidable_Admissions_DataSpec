# Welcome to the HDRUK Avoidable Admissions Collaboration Docs

This is a collection of the docs for the project and code snippets to help us all collaborate and share tools. 

## Project Aim

To understand variation across the country in acute hospital admissions and explore methods for identifying an avoidable acute admission

### Objectives

1.       Take a multi-regional approach to linking routine data to describe patterns of acute admission and regional variation in admissions over a defined period of time
2.       Analyse admission variation by factors including deprivation (measured by LSOA), time of day, day of week, waiting times
3.       Describe outcomes following acute admission including Length of stay, repeat hospital attendance or admission within 7 days of index attendance, death in hospital.
4.       Where possible explore linkage with primary care data to identify patients with long term conditions who have an avoidable admission
5.       Develop methods for identifying patients at high risk of an avoidable admission using: 
36 ambulatory care sensitive conditions [^1]
