Where possible explore linkage with primary care data to identify patients with long term conditions who have an avoidable admission Develop methods for identifying patients at high risk of an avoidable admission using: 36 ambulatory care sensitive conditions 1 .

Analysis Plan Describe acute admissions by demographics inc deprivation, type, time of day, day of week Describe outcomes - length of stay, death in hospital, attendance at ED and re admission within 7 and 30 days Establish the admission pattern using the ACSC codes Where possible identify what investigations and treatments were administered in hospital - consider whether hospital admission was necessary for these Where possible link to primary care records TBC and discussed added value Model which factors have a higher likelihood of avoidable admission - possible algorithm development for a predictive tool Reporting and Outputs Outputs will be in many formats including: 1. peer reviewed publication, 2. using social media e.g. blog posts, 3. conference presentations and through workshops. 4.
