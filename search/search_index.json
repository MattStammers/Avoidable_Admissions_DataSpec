Project Aim To understand variation across the country in acute hospital admissions and explore methods for identifying an avoidable acute admission Objectives Take a multi-regional approach to linking routine data to describe patterns of acute admission and regional variation in admissions over a defined period of time Analyse admission variation by factors including deprivation (measured by LSOA), time of day, day of week, waiting times Describe outcomes following acute admission including Length of stay, repeat hospital attendance or admission within 7 days of index attendance, death in hospital. Where possible explore linkage with primary care data to identify patients with long term conditions who have an avoidable admission Develop methods for identifying patients at high risk of an avoidable admission using: 36 ambulatory care sensitive conditions 1 Sections index - This navigation page documentation - Documentation for the project which can be published open source to encourage sharing code - Share repository for code snippets and explanation of how various parts of the code work guides - Guides for how to set things up for the project Project layout mkdocs.yml # The configuration file. docs/ index.md # The index page documentation.md # An explanation of the project documentation code.md # Codeshares and docstrings guides.md # Guides Purdy S, Griffin T, Salisbury C, Sharp D.
